# Krishan Patel's Personal Portfolio 
## Welcome to my personal portfolio! I developed a multi-page, mobile accessible react web-app to help showcase and demonstrate my personal projects. 
On the site you will find pictures and videos of my projects to better see how they function and additional information about my motivation behind and goals for  each project.
